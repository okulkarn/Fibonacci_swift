# Fibonacci_swift

This program computes the fibonacci series and check the divisibility of the last element with 3,5 and 15 and prints accordingly. It also checks if the last fibonacci element is prime.
n = legth of the series which the user inputs.
f(n) = function that computes the last element of the fibonacci series and the length of the series    
I have made assumptions that 0 is divisible by all numbers.
length of fibo must be less than the value of long int.
I have allowed the integers to overflow too as negative + positive give + and -
